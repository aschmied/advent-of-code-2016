# Advent of Code 2016

This repo contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016) puzzles. I'm reading [Martin's Clean Code book](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) while solving these, so I'm trying to apply the principles from that book.

# Example

I tested these with Python 2.7.8. Run them like:

    cd day01
    python main.py

or for the unit tests:

    cd day01
    python -m unittest discover
